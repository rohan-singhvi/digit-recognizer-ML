# digit-recognizer-ML
This is a handwritten digit recognizer based on using convolutional neural networks (a form of artificial neural networks most often based on visual imagery) written in Python with the use of the MNIST dataset, available through Keras.

Inspired and taught by the following websites for data usage and training:

UI and the initial idea was inspired by the following:
